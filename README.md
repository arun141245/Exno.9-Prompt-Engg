## **Aim**

To explore, analyze, and understand different prompting techniques such as basic prompting, zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, descriptive prompting, multimodal prompting, storyboard prompting, and camera/motion prompting for effective video generation using AI models such as Runway Gen-2, Pika Labs, Luma, and Synthesia.

## **Algorithm**

1. **Select AI video generation models** (Runway Gen-2, Luma, Pika, Synthesia).
2. **Identify prompting techniques** to test:

   * Basic Prompting
   * Zero-Shot Prompting
   * Few-Shot Prompting
   * Descriptive Prompting
   * Camera/Motion Prompting
   * Style-Based Prompting
   * Storyboard (Multiframe) Prompting
   * Refinement/Iterative Prompting
3. **Create sample prompts** for each technique.
4. **Generate videos** using each prompt variation.
5. **Evaluate outputs** based on clarity, consistency, motion accuracy, visual quality, and style control.
6. **Save and compare results** to observe differences.
7. **Document findings** and present a comparison table.

## **Procedure**

### **Step 1 – Familiarize With Tools**

Explore available video generation tools:

* Runway Gen-2
* Luma Dream Machine
* Pika Labs
* Synthesia
  Understand capabilities, limitations, input formats, and output quality.

### **Step 2 – Apply Prompting Techniques**

#### **1. Basic Prompting**

“Generate a video of a person walking in a park.”
→ Simple output, minimal detail.

#### **2. Zero-Shot Prompting**

“Create a 5-second video of a person in a green park walking calmly along a pathway.”
→ Outputs structured visuals with mild improvements.

#### **3. Few-Shot Prompting**

Provide examples, then new prompt.
→ Output follows structure and style of examples.

#### **4. Descriptive Prompting**

“Generate a video of a man wearing a red jacket walking in a sunny park, birds flying above, slow camera panning sideways.”
→ More accurate and visually rich output.

#### **5. Camera & Motion Prompting**

“Camera slowly zooms out while following a car driving through a rainy city street at night.”
→ Better motion, cinematic feel.

#### **6. Style-Based Prompting**

“Create an animated cyberpunk-style video of a futuristic city with neon lights and flying vehicles.”
→ AI adapts specific style elements.

#### **7. Storyboard Prompting**

Frame-by-frame descriptions:

* Frame 1: Sunset at beach
* Frame 2: Waves approaching
* Frame 3: Camera lifts upward showing horizon
  → Better scene flow and coherence.

#### **8. Iterative Prompt Refinement**

Generate → review → adjust prompt
→ Highly improved final video.

### **Step 3 – Evaluate Video Outputs**

Analyze based on:

* Visual clarity
* Smoothness of motion
* Lighting accuracy
* Style consistency
* Relevance to prompt
* Coherence of motion between frames

### **Step 4 – Comparison Table**

| Prompting Technique  | Output Quality | Motion Accuracy | Style Control | Best Use Case             |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Basic Prompt         | Low            | Low             | Very Low      | Simple demos              |
| Zero-Shot            | Medium         | Medium          | Low           | Quick generation          |
| Few-Shot             | High           | Medium          | Medium        | Consistent style videos   |
| Descriptive Prompt   | High           | High            | High          | Realistic scenes          |
| Camera/Motion Prompt | Very High      | Very High       | Medium        | Cinematic shots           |
| Style-Based Prompt   | Medium         | Low             | Very High     | Artistic, animated videos |
| Storyboard Prompt    | High           | High            | High          | Sequential storytelling   |
| Iterative Prompting  | Very High      | High            | Very High     | Polished final videos     |

## **Result**

By experimenting with multiple prompting techniques across various AI video-generation models, it is observed that:

* **Descriptive prompts** and **camera/motion prompts** produce the most accurate and visually appealing videos.
* **Few-shot** and **storyboard prompting** give strong coherence and consistent style.
* **Basic prompting** gives low detail and is not suitable for professional outputs.
* **Iterative prompting** produces the highest quality results when refinement is required.

Thus, the effectiveness of video generation significantly improves as the complexity and clarity of the prompt increase.

---

## **Conclusion**

The experiment successfully demonstrates how different prompting techniques influence the quality, detail, coherence, and creativity of AI-generated videos. Structured and detailed prompting methods consistently yield superior results compared to basic or zero-shot methods. Understanding these techniques allows users to create more professional, cinematic, and refined video outputs using AI video-generation tools.
